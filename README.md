# api_practice_project

This is a repository for practicing:
  1. Pulling data with API's from python
  2. Parsing that data
  3. Writing the final data to a local file
  
The goal is to write a python program on your local computer that performs an API call
to the two files (Inventory.json and devices.json) in this repository and joins them
together so that your your final output is the same as the custom_inventory.json file.

Although the devices.json file and the custom_inventory.json file are the same, the goal
is to use the Inventory.json file as your starting file, and add the contents of the
devices.json file to it through the use of dictionary parsing to end up with the
custom_inventory.json file.
